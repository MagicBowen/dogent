# Original Requirements

## Release 0.9.22

- When I exit Dogent and then re-enter Dogent next time, I hope that by using the up arrow key, I can bring up the user prompts that exist in the history (those that have not been cleaned or archived).

- Currently, in Dogent, when the LLM is clarifying questions and confirming outlines, it does not comply well with the instructions in the system prompt that require returning structured text formats. A specific description of this issue and some references to possible solutions is in file : `dev/spikes/structure-format-message.md`. Need to provide a new design to address the problem.
