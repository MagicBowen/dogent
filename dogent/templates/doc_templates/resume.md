# Resume

## Introduction
A resume format optimized for experienced technical professionals (senior/staff+). Emphasizes work experience, measurable impact, and leadership.

## Writing Steps (Process)
1) Choose target role + seniority (1–2 titles) and target domain (e.g., infra, backend, ML platform).
2) Inventory your last 2–4 roles and 3–6 highest-impact initiatives per role.
3) Convert initiatives into impact bullets using: Action + What + How + Result (metrics).
4) Draft headline + summary that align to the target role and reflect scale + outcomes.
5) Build skills section by category; include only what you can discuss deeply.
6) Add Projects only if highly relevant and stronger than additional experience bullets.
7) Final pass: tighten language, remove weak bullets, ensure consistent formatting, optimize for page 1 scan.

## Writing Requirements (Experienced Technical)
- Length: 2~3 pages (default); 3 pages is common for 8+ years experience.
- Order: Header → Summary → Skills → Experience → (Projects) → Education → (Certifications).
- Bullets: 3–6 per role; lead with strongest outcomes; start with action verbs.
- Metrics: quantify impact wherever possible (latency, reliability, cost, revenue, throughput, adoption, time saved, incident reduction).
- Style: concise, scannable, no long paragraphs, no first-person pronouns.

## Skills (How to Write Them)
Group skills by category and prioritize depth. Example categories:
- Languages: (e.g., Go, Java, Python, TypeScript)
- Backend / Distributed Systems: (e.g., microservices, REST/gRPC, Kafka, caching)
- Cloud / Infra: (e.g., AWS/GCP/Azure, Kubernetes, Terraform)
- Data: (e.g., Spark, Airflow, dbt, data modeling)
- Observability / Reliability: (e.g., SLIs/SLOs, tracing, alerting, incident response)
- Security: (e.g., IAM, threat modeling, secure SDLC)
- Architecture / Leadership: (e.g., system design, tech strategy, mentoring, cross-team alignment)

Rules:
- List only what you can explain and defend in interviews.
- Match the job description keywords (truthfully).
- Avoid unstructured “everything” lists.

## Best Practices (Senior/Staff-Oriented)
- Make scope visible: users/traffic, services owned, data volume, team size, org impact.
- Show ownership: “Owned”, “Led”, “Designed”, “Drove”, “Established”, “Mentored”.
- Prefer outcomes over responsibilities; each bullet should answer “so what?”
- Use credible metrics and baselines when possible (from X to Y).
- Highlight architecture and decision-making: tradeoffs, constraints, migrations, reliability improvements.
- Keep formatting consistent: dates, location style, tense (past for past roles, present for current).
- ATS-friendly: simple headings, standard section names, avoid heavy tables/graphics.

## Output Structure (Experience-First for Technical Professionals)

```markdown

## Header
- Full Name
- Target Title (e.g., Senior Backend Engineer)
- Location (City, State) | Email | Phone | LinkedIn | GitHub/Portfolio

## Summary
- 2–4 lines: years of experience, specialization, scale, and 1–2 standout impacts.
  - Example: “Backend engineer with 10+ years building distributed systems at high scale; led migration to Kubernetes and reduced infra spend 18% while improving reliability to 99.95%.”

## Skills
- 3–6 grouped categories (see Skills section rules)

## Experience
- Title — Company, Location | Dates
  - Impact bullet (Action + What + How + Result with metric)
  - Impact bullet
  - Leadership/process bullet (mentoring, cross-team, roadmap, incident mgmt)
  - Optional: tech stack line (short, relevant)

(Repeat for 2–4 most recent roles; older roles can be condensed.)

## Projects (Optional)
- Project Name — 1 line description + measurable outcome + tech
  - Keep to 1–3 projects max; only if relevant to target role.

## Education
- Degree — School | Dates (optional graduation year if early career or required)
- Optional: relevant coursework only if it adds value

## Certifications (Optional)
- Certification — Issuer | Year (only if relevant and current)
